# Changelog

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-21 — README polish (P3, docs only)

- Marketing-oriented README: added **Why Flario** (differentiators), **Examples**
  (natural-language agent asks → tools, with a real proof-carrying price output),
  and a no-client **Verify it works** quickstart. No code changes; ships the
  polished README to the npm package page too.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-21 — Flare portfolio + agent identity (edge path P2)

- **`get_flr_stake_info`** (new): one-call "Flare portfolio" for an address —
  native FLR + wrapped WFLR, FTSO vote power and delegation (WNat/VPToken),
  claimable protocol rewards broken down by source (RewardManager
  `getStateOfRewards` — read-only, no claim proofs needed), and FlareDrops
  (DistributionToDelegators, best-effort). All four networks; each section
  degrades gracefully where a contract is absent/inactive.
- **`fassets_agent_details`** (new): human-facing agent info — name,
  description, logo/icon URL, terms-of-use URL and whitelist status from the
  AgentOwnerRegistry. Accepts an agent vault or an owner management address.
- 19 tools; 74 tests. Live-verified on mainnet (real agent "Oracle-daemon"
  name/logo resolved; portfolio reads incl. reward source breakdown).

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-21 — proof-carrying FTSO feeds

Deepening enshrined-stack coverage (the "be the complete Flare MCP" track).

- **`get_ftso_anchor_feed`** (new): proof-carrying FTSO Scaling price — the
  value plus a Merkle proof verified **locally** against the on-chain Relay
  root (FTSO Scaling protocol id 100). Trust-minimized: an agent or a smart
  contract can rely on it without trusting the DA API. Leaf construction
  (`keccak256(abi.encode(body))`, sorted-pair fold) was resolved empirically
  and cross-confirmed against `FtsoV2Interface.verifyFeedData`. Resolves any
  feed by name (the full ~100+ anchor catalog) or `bytes21` id. All networks.
- **`get_ftso_history`** (fixed): now works against the **public** Flare Data
  Availability layer out of the box — no external indexer / `FLARE_DA_LAYER_API`
  needed. Returns recent anchor-feed points, each optionally Merkle-verified.
  All four networks.
- 17 tools; 70 tests (added offline anchor-feed verification fixtures).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-21 — Flario

Project renamed from `@dziuba0x/flare-mcp` to **Flario** (npm: `flario`; command:
`npx flario`; repo: github.com/dziuba0x/flario). Same tool, own brand — an
agent-native MCP server for Flare with x402 payments and chain-verified receipts.

- **No functional changes.** All 16 tools, both transports (stdio + HTTP hub),
  the x402 layer, receipts and FDC-verified settlement are unchanged. Only names
  moved: package `flario`, bin `flario`, MCP server name `flario`, receipt schema
  `flario-receipt/1`, hub env vars `FLARIO_HTTP_HOST`/`FLARIO_HTTP_PORT` (the
  Flare-network vars `FLARE_RPC*`, `FLARE_PRIVATE_KEY` keep the `FLARE_` prefix).
- Migration from `@dziuba0x/flare-mcp`: change the package to `flario` and the
  command to `npx flario`; update the mcpServers key if you used `flare-mcp`.
  The old package is deprecated with a pointer to `flario`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-21 — ZK-ready receipts + FDC-verified settlement

The settlement layer's organ 3: receipts, and the enshrined-FDC proof that
makes them trust-minimized.

- **`x402_receipt`**: every settled payment now emits a fixed-schema,
  self-describing, portable receipt (`src/x402/receipt.ts`,
  [`RECEIPT_SPEC.md`](RECEIPT_SPEC.md)). The payer appears only as a
  **Poseidon (BN254) commitment**, never in plaintext; a keccak256
  `receipt_hash` gives any holder tamper-evidence. Payers may blind the
  commitment with an optional `commitment_salt` in the payment payload (not
  part of the EIP-712 authorization — it cannot affect fund movement).
  Additive: `x402_payment_receipt` (settlement summary) is unchanged;
  `x402_receipt` is emitted alongside it on both transports.
- **`fdc_verify_settlement`** (new tool): proves an x402 settlement via
  Flare's **enshrined FDC** — an EVMTransaction attestation over the
  settlement tx, locally Merkle-verified against the on-chain Relay root, then
  *bound* to the payment (the attested tx must contain an ERC-20 Transfer of
  the asset to the payee for ≥ the amount). Populates the receipt's
  `fdc_attestation_ref`, making the settlement provable without trusting the
  facilitator. Never submits on-chain itself (no gas-griefing surface).
  Live-verified end-to-end on Coston2, including rejection of mismatched
  amount/payee.
- New dependency: `poseidon-lite` (small, dependency-free Poseidon).
- 16 tools total; 65 tests.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-17 — hub mode (hosted HTTP + spec-style x402)

- **`--http [port]` / `FLARE_MCP_HTTP_PORT`**: run flare-mcp as a hostable
  service — MCP over Streamable HTTP at `POST /mcp` (stateless, all 15
  tools) plus REST premium endpoints paid via **standard HTTP x402**
  (`402` + `accepts[]` → `X-Payment` header → result +
  `X-Payment-Response` with the settlement tx). Wire-compatible with the
  existing x402 client ecosystem; no new runtime dependencies (plain
  `node:http`).
- `GET /` discovery document (endpoints, x402 config), `GET /healthz`.
- `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` for one-command deployment; binds
  `127.0.0.1` by default, `FLARE_MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose.
- stdio mode unchanged and still the default.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-17 — x402 payment layer

- **x402 payments over MCP** (`src/x402/`): paid tools reply with payment
  requirements; the client signs an EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization`
  off-chain and retries with `x402_payment` (base64 JSON); the built-in
  facilitator verifies the EIP-712 signature locally, checks the nonce
  on-chain, settles `transferWithAuthorization` on Flare and attaches the
  settlement tx hash to the result. The facilitator never holds funds.
  Disabled by default (`X402_ENABLED=true` to enable; mainnet additionally
  behind `X402_ALLOW_MAINNET=true`). Prices per tool via env.
- **`fassets_liquidation_scanner`** (premium): joins FAssets agent state with
  live FTSOv2 prices — per agent: CR headroom against the collateral-type
  minimums, the underlying price at which liquidation starts, and the % move
  away from it.
- **`fdc_bulk_proof_bundle`** (premium): batch retrieval of up to 20 FDC
  proofs, each Merkle-verified locally against the on-chain Relay root.
- Demo agent: `scripts/x402-demo-client.ts` (MCP stdio client that pays and
  retries autonomously).
- Payment tokens verified on-chain: mainnet USD₮0 has EIP-3009 (docs +
  functional probe); Coston2 default is a verified EIP-3009 test USDT0.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-15

flare-mcp v2: FDC attestation workflows, deep FAssets state, Songbird/Coston
support, FCC registry watcher.

### Added

- **`fdc_request_attestation`** — prepare an FDC attestation request
  (`Payment`, `AddressValidity`, `EVMTransaction`) via the Flare-hosted
  verifiers, quote the request fee from `FdcRequestFeeConfigurations`, and —
  when `FLARE_PRIVATE_KEY` is set — submit it to `FdcHub` and return the tx
  hash and voting round id. Without a key, returns the prepared request for
  submission with your own signer.
- **`fdc_get_attestation_proof`** — fetch an attestation proof from the Data
  Availability layer and verify it **locally**: the response struct is
  ABI-encoded and keccak-hashed into a Merkle leaf, folded through the proof,
  and compared to `Relay.merkleRoots(200, round)` read on-chain. A DA-layer
  response that does not match the on-chain root is rejected.
- **`fassets_agent_status`** — per-agent view (FXRP live on mainnet, Coston2,
  Songbird): collateral ratios, minting capacity in free lots,
  minted/reserved/redeeming amounts, liquidation status; sorted riskiest
  first.
- **`fassets_system_state`** — global stats: total minted, agent count, lot
  size, minting cap and pause flag, aggregated vault + pool collateral, and
  the redemption queue (tickets, value, lots) with pagination.
- **`songbird_fcc_registry`** — scans the live FlareContractRegistry for
  Flare Confidential Compute contracts (PMW / TEE / compute extensions).
  Reports `not_yet_publicly_addressable` today (per dev.flare.network/fcc,
  FCC is not yet public) and will surface the contracts the moment they are
  registered.
- **Songbird (chain 19) and Coston (chain 16)** network support; existing
  tools `get_flr_balance`, `get_ftso_feed`, `get_ftso_feeds_all` and
  `get_fdc_proof_status` now accept them too.
- Offline test suite (`npm test`, vitest) with recorded on-chain fixtures,
  plus `scripts/live-check.ts` acceptance checks against public RPCs.

### Changed

- Contract ABIs now come from the official
  `@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contract-artifacts` package at runtime
  instead of being hand-written, for the large FDC/FAssets interfaces.
- DA-layer JSON is parsed with 64-bit-safe number handling
  (`lowestUsedTimestamp = 2^64-1` no longer loses precision).

### Migration notes (0.1.x → 0.2.0)

- **No breaking changes** to existing tools: names, inputs and outputs are
  unchanged. The `network` enum on the four tools listed above now
  *additionally* accepts `"songbird"` and `"coston"`.
- The server is no longer strictly read-only **only if you opt in**: setting
  `FLARE_PRIVATE_KEY` lets `fdc_request_attestation` submit transactions
  (attestation requests cost a small fee, e.g. 1000 wei on Coston2, plus
  gas). Leave it unset for the previous read-only behaviour — every other
  tool remains read-only regardless.
- New optional env vars: `FLARE_RPC_SONGBIRD`, `FLARE_RPC_COSTON`,
  `FLARE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FDC_VERIFIER_API_KEY`, `FLARE_DA_API_KEY`,
  `FLARE_DA_URL`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-28

Initial release: `get_flr_balance`, `get_ftso_feed`, `get_ftso_feeds_all`,
`get_ftso_providers`, `get_ftso_history`, `get_fassets_status`,
`get_fdc_proof_status`, `get_smart_account_info`; mainnet + Coston2; stdio
transport.
